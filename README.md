### About Me

Hello! My name is Sachin and I am a Machine Learning Engineer. I like to tell stories with data!

I feel being a Machine Learning Engineer is lot like a detective. I love finding patterns in data, dive deep into world of data and you never know what you might find that is helpful to everyone in the world.  🌍

When I am not coding I like to paint 🎨🖌️. I am an avid reader 📚 that's where I get most of ideas from and it helps me see the world around me through different perspective. Apart from that I am a poet and love spoken word poetry 🎤
